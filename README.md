To update an application with a new AMI using Terraform without stopping the application, you can use a rolling update strategy. This approach involves creating a new set of instances with the updated AMI and then replacing the old instances incrementally. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Strategy Overview
1. Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Use an ASG to manage the instances, allowing you to replace instances without downtime.
2. Update the Launch Template/Configuration: Modify the AMI in the launch template or launch configuration.
3. Rolling Update: Use Terraform to incrementally replace instances by changing the configuration in the ASG, ensuring that the application remains available throughout the process.
